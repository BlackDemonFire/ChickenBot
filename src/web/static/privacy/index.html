    <p>
        For issues and questions about privacy or the bot, send an email to <a href="mailto:antti@antti.codes">antti@antti.codes</a> or dm on Discord Chicken#4127.<br>
        Stored data can be removed by two ways. Either by contacting me or using <strong>datareset</strong> command.<br>
        If sent via email, include your Discord <strong>ID</strong> on your message.<br>
        Your id can be obtained by enabling developer mode, right clicking your username in a message and clicking copy id.<br>
        Optionally you can add a reason for this request to make me improve the system.<br>
        Your leveling system data will automatically be removed on leaving a guild.<br>
        <br>
        Collected data is not shared with anyone. All data is for internal usage of the bot only.<br>
        <br>
        Bot collected data from guild include the id of guild and data given by using the settings command.<br>
        Data collected from users include their id, leveling system xp and data given to the bot by using the remind command.<br>
        <br>
        Ids are collected to be able to link bot data to discord user or guild.<br>
        Bot data include bot's settings in guild, reminders and leveling system xp.<br>
        <br>
        This data is needed for bot features to work.<br>
        If you don't want data to be collected. Don't use the bot.<br>
        <br>
        I'm not a lawyer, I have no idea what to write.<br>
        Please drop suggestions in my email above and ask questions if this is unclear.
